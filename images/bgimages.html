            MOUNTAINS
            A mountain is an elevated portion of the Earth's crust,<br>
            generally with steep sides that show significant exposed bedrock.<br>
            A mountain differs from a plateau in having a limited summit area,<br>
            and is larger than a hill, typically rising at least 300 metres (1000 feet) above the surrounding land.
